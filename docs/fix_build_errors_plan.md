# Fix Build Errors Plan

## Critical Build Error Identified

The application deployment on Vercel is failing with the following error:
```
Error [PrismaClientInitializationError]: Prisma has detected that this project was built on Vercel, which caches dependencies. This leads to an outdated Prisma Client because Prisma's auto-generation isn't triggered. To fix this, make sure to run the `prisma generate` command during the build process.
```

## Primary Fix: Add Prisma Generate to Build Process

The main issue is that Prisma Client is not being generated during the Vercel build process. This happens because Vercel caches dependencies, and the Prisma Client is not getting properly regenerated with the correct database schema.

### Solution Steps:

1. **Update package.json build script:**
   - [ ] Modify the build script to include Prisma generate command before Next.js build
   - [ ] Update the script to: `"build": "prisma generate && next build"`

2. **Verify Prisma client usage:**
   - [ ] Ensure consistent import syntax across all files: `import { prisma } from "@/lib/prisma"`
   - [ ] Avoid default imports from prisma

3. **Test locally:**
   - [ ] Run the updated build command locally to verify it works
   - [ ] Confirm the Prisma client is properly generated

## Additional Optimizations

- [ ] Consider adding a `postinstall` script to automatically run `prisma generate` after `npm install`
- [ ] Ensure all database connections are properly closed in serverless functions
- [ ] Implement connection pooling best practices for serverless environments
- [ ] Update documentation to note the Prisma generate requirement for deployment

## Files to Modify

- [ ] `package.json` - Update build script
- [ ] `README.md` - Update deployment instructions
- [ ] `docs/CHANGELOG.md` - Document the build fix

## Next Steps After Fix

1. Deploy to Vercel with the updated build script
2. Monitor the build logs to confirm successful Prisma generation
3. Test all database-dependent features in production
4. Document the solution in the project wiki/documentation

## Status
*Plan created. Proceeding with implementing the Prisma build fix and documentation updates.*
